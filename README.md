### Hi, I'm Kyrie âœ¨
I'm an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in Information Security. Currently, I'm an exchange student at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). I'm expected to graduate in June 2024.

I am interested in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning.

- I'm one of the contributors of [SecretFlow](https://github.com/secretflow/secretflow), a framework for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, implementing Label Leakage Attacks for Split Learning.
- I collaborated to propose [HarsanyiNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01811), a novel network that can calculate Shapley values in a single forward propagation, facilitating the attribution of inputs in order to explain the black box.
- I am currently working on proposing a method to add semantic-level watermarks, to distinguish between images generated by Stable Diffusion and real-life photos.

This is my [Curriculum Vitae]().
